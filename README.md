## Brief Description

<p>The realtime expression detector is designed using  Media Pipe and Python. Users can be able to leverage
their webcam to decode what their body language says at a point in time. So, specifically in
order to do this, the detector is leveraging pre-trained data as well as a custom machine learning model
to be able to take the landmarks from user's face as well as different poses from their body.</p>
